# WINNIE KELLEY'S PORTFOLIO

### My live link is https://wk642.github.io/portfolio-website/

### This is a portfolio website is the first step to building my portfolio. So far I used:

1. HTML
2. CSS - exploring grid for the first time
3. JavaScript

### The page includes the following:

1. Short description about me
2. a nav bar
3. my skills
4. my contact information
5. a contact form that requires name and email

### Excited to keep working on this and making it better as I learn new knowledge.
